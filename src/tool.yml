        description: |
          The variables to download. If 'all' is selected, all variables 
          will be processed. You can also use wildcards to process multiple files of one variable at once, e.g. `pp*.nc`.

        type: boolean
        default: replace
        description: |
          If true, existing files will be skipped. If false, existing files will be replaced.

        type: integer
        optional: true
        description: |
          The number of areas to process in one batch. This can be used to prevent memory issues when processing large 
          numbers areas. Try decreasing this number if you encounter memory issues. By default, all areas are processed
          in one batch.
