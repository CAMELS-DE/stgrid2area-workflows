    description: Uses the stgrid2area package to clip and aggregate E-OBS data to (catchment) areas.
    version: 0.1
    parameters:
      areas_id_column: 
        type: string
        description: The name of the column in the areas file that contains the unique identifier for each area.

        description: |
          The path to the Dask scheduler file, which describes the Dask cluster to use for parallel processing.  
          Necessary in HPC environments, e.g. use the `--scheduler-file` option of when starting a Dask cluster 
          with `mpirun`.
          If not provided, the tool will create a local cluster.
